# Reflection

 The goal at the start of the project was to make a clone of Angry Birds using the Matter js engine. One thing I wish we had more of was in-class time. I had a lot of questions regarding matter js such as using mouse constraints properly and more efficient ways to run an engine within a world, but time did not allow me to go in-depth and make a better game. I was not able to get the project to the level I would’ve wanted, but I am still happy with my result as I have a functioning game with decent UI.

## Problems that occurred

- The biggest struggle I had while making the game was applying the Matter js library. Some of the references were not clear and the examples given were not tied with the P5 library, so when trying to recreate the examples to gain an understanding, I ran into several issues which I was able to figure out.
- I ran into an issue when I was trying to make a restart button as I could not figure out an efficient way to make the world reset itself and would result in a lot of bugs. I decided to not include that feature as it needed a lot more work to function properly and more time was needed for that.
- Due to my inexperience with the engine, I was not able to fully understand how to completely clear an engine and clear objects from the world which prevented me from expanding with the code and adding more features such as restart, coins, and more levels. 
- I also attempted to use glass in my code that would shatter when hit. While I was able to make the glass disappear, I could not make it shatter visibly which made the game look tacky. I decided to opt-out of glass and use stone instead.

## Takeaways

- I worked on making files and making a new file when I made a concept work. A major issue I ran into through making the code was an error from the Matter js library and I would not be able to solve the issue. Instead of having to ctrl+z my way back, I copied the previous folder which was working, and I would try to apply the concept in a different way. This way I could ensure I had the most efficient code to my ability.
- I should’ve planned the way I set up my code earlier on. For the first couple of days, I was not sure of what I was going to do and this threw off any main ideas I may have had to implement last minute. Instead, I should’ve made a plan based on the time I had and worked on my project according to that. This would have allowed me to write cleaner code with fewer variables but the way I set my engine up required some variables due to how the P5 and Matter library work.
- Overall I am happy with what I have accomplished as I have met all of my needs and successfully implemented most of my nice to haves. The game plays decently with no major bugs. I would’ve liked to be able to replay levels but I could not efficiently clear the world preventing a level from being able to play again. I am happy that I was able to understand Matter js to the extent that I have and it tied quite well with what we have learned in class, object-oriented programming.
